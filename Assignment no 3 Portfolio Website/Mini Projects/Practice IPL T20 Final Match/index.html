        <h2>Final Match :-</h2>
        <p>
          The IPL 2024 final match between Kolkata Knight Riders
          <i>(KKR)</i> and Sunrisers Hyderabad <i>(SRH)</i> was full of exciting
          moments, with <i>KKR</i>
          emerging victorious by 8 wickets to claim their third IPL title​.
        </p>
        <h4>
          Here are some key and interesting highlights from the final match:
        </h4>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <b>Shreyas Iyer's Captaincy:</b> <i>KKR</i> captain Shreyas Iyer led
            the team to victory with his strategic captaincy and crucial runs.
            His leadership on the field was pivotal in guiding <i>KKR</i> to the
            win​.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <b>Sunil Narine's All-Round Performance:</b> Sunil Narine delivered
            a standout performance with both bat and ball. He took key wickets
            to restrict SRH's scoring and also contributed important runs during
            <i>KKR's</i> innings​.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <b>Spectacular Fielding :</b> <i>KKR's</i> fielders displayed
            outstanding skills, with impressive catches and run-outs. A
            highlight moment was Eoin Morgan's stunning catch at the boundary,
            which disrupted SRH's momentum​.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <b>Importance of the Toss:</b> <i>SRH</i> won the toss and chose to
            bat first, but their innings lacked consistency and they could only
            manage <i>113</i> runs. <biKKR's< /i> bowlers, including Mitchell
            Starc and Varun Chakravarthy, quickly dismissed <i>SRH's</i> top
            order​.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
